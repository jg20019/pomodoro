# Pomodoro Timer

A simple pomodoro app used to track how many pomodoros I have completed on a given day. 

This app is very incomplete. The following are some features that still need to be added. 
* A backend so that we can add authentication/persistence. 
* Authentication so that multiple users can use it
* Persistence so that users can view records over time. 
* An alarm that sounds when the timer finishes. Right now it silenty moves to the home screen. 
* Tests (?) though I am not sure how/what to test
